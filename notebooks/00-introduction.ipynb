    "- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a fundamental library for numerical computing offering support for N-dimensional arrays and scientific computing tasks, such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, and matrix manipulation. The official NumPy website provides [tutorials](https://numpy.org/learn/) and [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a widely-used plotting library for creating visualizations in Python. The official Matplotlib website offers [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html) and [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use these and several other libraries throughout the semester. You can install packages directly from the terminal using the pip installer. `pip` is Python’s built-in **package manager**.  To install NumPy and MatplotLib run in your terminal:\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
